# GRB_LIV_Hierarchical
This repository includes the spectral lag data sets of a sample of GRBs used in the literature. 

The data sets of spectral lags of 32 GRBs can be found in the 'data/GRB_lag/' directory. In each GRBName.txt file, we provide the medium of each energy band adopted to calculate the time lags (with using a lowest energy band as reference), the 1sigma error of each energy band, the time lag, and the 1sigma error of time lag. 

In the 'GRB_information.txt', we privide the entire energy band adopted to extracting the Fermi-GBM light curves of each GRB, and the redshift of each burst.
